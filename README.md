# Microsoft Dynamics NAV in Docker

This GitHub repository aims to provide a centralized location for community engagement. In here you will find documentation, Dockerfiles and additional developer resources. 

## It has not been decided yet, to which extend Microsoft will ship Docker images with NAV, so everything in this repo is work in progress and might be subject to deletion.

Dynamics NAV in Docker is based on a generic image, which can run any version of NAV (NAV 2016 and up).
Specific images with a specific version of NAV can be built using the generic image and a NAV DVD.

Visit the [Microsoft Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/microsoft) for more information and additional images.
